## School Fit
School Fit was conceived, designed, implemented, presented, and awarded first place at [Health 2.0â€²s Washington DC HD&IW Code-a-thon](http://www.health2con.com/devchallenge/washington-dcs-hdi-code-a-thon-preventing-obesity/).

See it in action at [schoolfit.herokuapp.com](http://schoolfit.herokuapp.com/).


## Source Code
The School Fit Team has graciously allowed me, Ryan Duryea, the software developer on the team, to Open Source the code that runs the School Fit website.


## Initial Development
The bulk of the work on the website was completed over 1.5 days during the Health 2.0 2012 Washington DC Code-a-thon.  The tag "v0.1" represents all the work that was completed during the Code-a-thon.

Since that time, I've added an about page that recognizes the contributions and skills that each member brought to the School Fit project.
